This repository contains PowerBI data analysis projects.
The KPMG Data Project highlights the data analysis if Sprockert Customer Data and the company is interested in understanding the customer behaivour to target the marketing strategies for business growth.
Using data analysis skill set, I have tried to answer some of the business related questions that will help in business decision making.


In other PowerBI project, Nobel prize distribution data has been imported to PowerBI to understand Nobel Prize distribution from 1901-2019 with the help of DAX formulas and tools associated with POWERBI
At the end, I was able to draw some interesting insights about the Nobel Prize distribution.
